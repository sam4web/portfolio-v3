# I‚Äôm Sijal Manandhar, a developer who loves to innovate. üëãüèª

I focus on creating practical, data-driven solutions that fit each project's needs. I handle everything from front-end design to back-end functionality, ensuring tasks are done efficiently and logically. My goal is to build web experiences that improve lives, bring ideas to life, and make a positive impact.

As a developer, I love combining my technical skills with design principles to build scalable, efficient applications that deliver seamless and engaging user experiences. With 2 years of experience as a web developer, I have designed and developed numerous websites and web applications.

I'm actively seeking a dynamic work environment to further refine my skills. My passion for continuous learning and innovation drives me to adapt quickly and solve problems proactively. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, hiking, or working on personal projects. I'm eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a forward-thinking team
